  <h1>I'm Learning HTML!</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there! So, school holidays can get boring, right? But guess what? My mom had this super cool idea! She suggested me to learn HTML, just for fun!
  </p>
  <p>
    You know what's even more fun? I learned HTML from this awesome website called <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. They have these cool tutorials and examples that make it super easy to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    And you know what I did? I created my own HTML pages to show you what I've learned! Isn't that exciting? Check them out below!
    <br>
    My favorite topic so far is the <a href="i-learn-html-04-color.html">Chapter 04-1: HTML More Colors</a>. It's so cool to play with different colors on a web page!
  </p>
